        "Introduction": "Knowledge of ahadith is essential in an effort to understand Islam.\nThey contain rules and regulations, when implemented, would give cause to a better understanding of everyday life.\nThis is applicable, to the individual of a society and also to the society as a whole.\nThe messages within the ahadith are for the benefit of both, individual and society.\nAmong many missions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), one was to set a pattern of conduct.\nThe conduct of the Last Messenger (peace be upon him) can be found in the voluminous sahihs.\nWe should make an attempt to abide by these rules.\nIt is unnecessary to mention that research of Islam is beyond the scope of a single individual, a task unattainable in a man's lifetime, not to say, impossible.\nTo narrow my scope, I had decided to restrict myself to ahadith (even this is a large area of study within Islam).\nI decided on making a small collection of ahadith.\nThis decision resulted in a minor project that essentially consisted of reading diverse Islamic literature and reading different aspects of Islam.\nI could, of course, have bought one of many voluminous compilations of ahadith, but I was convinced that I would learn more by finding and compiling them myself and indeed it has been a most fruitful experience.\nDuring the compilation, I was becoming aware of the meaning and importance of ahadith and soon realised that others too could benefit from this compilation.\nWith this in mind I was determined to share this collection with my fellow Muslims.\nAll ahadith in this collection have been, so to say, copied from my source (NOTE A) .Every hadith is followed by the Arabic source it can be found in (e.g.\nBukhari, Muslim) along with the source I have written it from (e.g.\nSayings of Muhammad by Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nIf the reader feels uncertain about a particular hadith she/he can easily trace it to my source.\nAll the footnotes in the ahadith are not my insertions, but the author's of my sources.\nThe titles which are given to the ahadith are also titles found in my source, they too, are not my insertions.\nThe same applies for brackets ( ( ) or [] ) found within some ahadith.\n(These comments do not apply to the titles marked as \"Introduction\" and \"Introduction to Ahadith\") The ahadith are all randomly compiled.\nThe ahadith have been written down as I have encountered them in relevant literature.\nSince I have used different literature, there have come cases where two authors use the same title, e.i.\n\"marriage\" hence the title will appear twice.\nThis is not to be regarded as a misprint.\nThere is no personal preference as to the choice of authors of my sources.\nI have obtained these books from different libraries and local mosques.\nA problem which was encountered was when two authors wrote on the same subject matter, but from different sahihs, both sahihs had their own wordings but giving the same meaning.\nI have tried to keep these sort of ahadith to a minimal as I wished to have as many diverse topics as possible.\nFaith, knowledge, marriage, sex, divorce, rights of wives/husbands and hospitality are a couple of areas covered in this compilation.\nI have, to the very best of my abilities, tried to be as careful as possible when writing from the source, this in order not to endanger the real meaning of the hadith, nor to give cause to misinterpretations.\nAs far as spellings are concerned, I have thoroughly checked it.\nThe spellings of Arabic names and places have been written exactly as I have encountered them in the source.\nOne of my sources, \"Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen\" written by, Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi, has consistently used the term \"Rasulullah\" when addressing Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him).\nThe Arabic term, \"sallallahu alayhi wasallam\" has also been used throughout the book.\nFor the ease of non-Muslim readers, I have replaced the Arabic \"Rasulullah\" by \"Muhammad\" and \"sallallahu alayhi wasallam\" by \"may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him.\" I have treated similarly the terms \"radiallahu anhu\" and \"radiallahu anha.\" They have been replaced by \"Allah be pleased with him\" and \"Allah be pleased with her.\" I have used the term \"peace be upon him\" throughout the compilation as most authors have used similar attributes.\nThe same author has also mentioned the narrators' Arabic names for most ahadith, I have done likewise.\nConsidering the fact that I am a computer science student (August, 1993), with access to Internet, I thought this would serve as a most remarkable media for distribution of this collection.\nIt is recommended, to those readers who have the possibilities, to print out the file and (NOTE B) send a copy to the local mosques who might wish to include this compilation in their library etc.\nIf mosques have the possibilities to print copies of this collection and have it distributed among the visitors/guests to the mosques, it would be appreciated.\nThus the collection will not only be restricted to people with network access.\nThe more people who read it, the more it will benefit and also the one who passes on the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him) will also be rewarded by Allah.\nThere is no doubt about this.\nThis compilation is dedicated to the loving memories of my maternal grandfather with whom I spent my first years of a precious life.\nIntroduction to Ahadith It goes without saying that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has left us with two powerful sources for the improvement of the individual, the society and for the nations, those are: the Holy Quran and ahadith.\nThe Quran was revealed to the Last Messenger (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel.\nThe ahadith show us the diversities a single person can have, and the ways these diversities may be used to produce an optimal performance, where the performance is exemplary for future generations.\nThis was one of the main tasks of the Last Messenger (peace be upon him), to guide humanity on the right path.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) was a son, a husband, a father, an advisor, a warrior, a leader, a judge and most important of all, he was the Seal of the Prophets - the last messenger of Allah.\nA man with such a character and such a vast field of responsibility is indeed deserving of biographical study, and through the ages, biographical researches have been carried out.\nThe collection of ahadith is the result of these researchers.\nThe study of ahadith is a science itself.\nTo mention some branches within the study of ahadith, there is the science of Asma'ul Rijal (the science of study of the life-history of 500,000 narrators), the science of Mustalih al-Hadith (the science of classifying a hadith as authentic or weak), the science of Gharib al-hadith (the study of the linguistic origins of the difficult words used in ahadith).\nI have mentioned only three different sciences though this list can extend to over 100.\nThis again indicates the immense importance of ahadith and the importance of understanding them.\nThe main source of ahadith can be found in six sahihs (NOTE C) These six sahihs are: Sahih al-Bukhari (d.\n256 A.H.\n= 870 A.D.) Sahih Muslim (d.\n261 A.H.\n= 875 A.D.) Sunan Ibn Majah (d.\n273 A.H.\n= 887 A.D.) Sunan Abu Dawud (d.\n275 A.H.\n= 888 A.D.) Jami al-Tirmidhi (d.\n279 A.H.\n= 892 A.D.) Sunan al-Nisai (d.\n303 A.H.\n= 915 A.D.) A.H.\n= After Hegira A.D.\n= Anno Domini \"In preparing their collections, these Traditions obviously used a critical technique to decide what they would include and what they should reject.\nBukhari, for example, examined 600,000 traditions of which he excepted only 7,397.\nThere purpose was to assemble a body of traditions which would serve as a rule of life for practising Muslims, so their primary interest was in selecting such traditions as would give clear guidance concerning what Muslims belief and practice should be, what things were permissible and approved, and what were not permissible and disapproved.\" (Shariah: The Islamic Law.\nby Abdur Rahman I.\nDoi:54) It should be quite evident from the above cited paragraph that the task of compiling ahadith was by no means simple.\nAlthough the most painstaking techniques had been employed to decide which ahadith should be included and which should be rejected there were found grounds for classification of ahadith.\nThe ahadith are therefore classified in the following manner: Sahih: These are the genuine Traditions so declared after applying all tests.\nHasan: These are the fair Traditions although inferior in the matter of authenticity to the Sahih.\nDaif: These are the weak traditions which are not so very reliable.\" (Ibid:57).\nBefore I proceed, I wish to explain the meanings of isnad and matn as the understanding of these words is considered profitable for the reader.\nA hadith consists of two parts.\nThe chain of transmitters comprises one part while the message within the hadith completes it.\nThe former is known as isnad while the latter is matn.\nContinuing with the classification of ahadith, the daif ahadith are divided further: The Mu'allaq Traditions: These are those Traditions in which one or two transmitters are omitted in the beginning of the Isnad.\nThe Maqtu Traditions: These are those Traditions which are reported by a Tabi'i, a man of second category after the Prophet.\nThe Munqati Traditions: These are the broken Traditions.\nThe Mursal Traditions: These are the incomplete Traditions in the Isnad of which a companion (Sahabi) is omitted, e.g.\nA Tabi'i says, the Prophet said....\nThe Musahhaf Traditions: These are the traditions which have a mistake in words or letters of the Isnad or the Matn e.g.\nHasan is written as Hashan.\nThe Shadh Traditions: These are the traditions with a reliable chain of reporters but their meanings are contrary to other similarly attested Traditions narrated by the majority of the contemporary transmitters.\nThe Maudu Traditions: These are the fabricated and untrue Traditions.\" (Ibid:57).\nI have now presented a very short introduction to the background of ahadith.\nI would most strongly recommend the interested reader to read the book \"Shariah: The Islamic Law\" by Abdur Rahman I.\nDoi.\nIt is a book which I have used extensively and found most interesting and informative.\nThe same author has also published a book which is titled \"Non-Muslims under Shariah\", another informative book which I would recommend.\nLastly I would like to thank the people concerned in providing me with the facility for distributing this collection.\nWithout their help, time, and effort, I am quite certain that this work would not have come to the notice of so many people in so many places.\nMay Allah give them peace and bless them all.\nAmen.\nComments or questions/queries can be forwarded to this email address tayyabr@hotmail.com Include the word \"HADITHS\" in the \"Subject: \" field of your email when using the above mentioned address.\nThank you.\nA Muslim and Pakistani student Oslo, Norway Wa akhiro dawaana unilhamdolillah Rabb-i-il alaamin.\nRamdhan 1414 January 1994.\nFAITH (IMAN) 1.\nIslam is based on five things: the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His servant and messenger, the observance of the prayer, the payment of Zakat, the pilgrimage, and the fast during Ramadan.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n2.\nThe Muslim is he from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe, and the Emigrant is he who abandons what God has prohibited.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n3.\nNone of you believes till I am dearer to him than his father, his child and all mankind.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad) 4.\nHe who is not trustworthy has no Faith, and he who does not keep his Covenant has no religion.\n(Baihaqi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n5.\nWhat is Faith? When your good deed pleases you and your evil deed grieves you, you are a believer.\nWhat is Sin? When a thing disturbs (the peace of) your heart, give it up.\n(Ahmad).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nMAJOR SINS AND SIGNS OF HYPOCRISY 6.\nThe major sins are associating other objects of worship with God, disobedience to parents, murder, and deliberate perjury.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n7.\nThere are three signs of a hypocrite: when he speaks he speaks lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is trusted he betrays his trust.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n8.\nAvoid the seven noxious things.(1) Associating anything with God, (2) magic,(3) killing one whom God has declared inviolate without a just cause, (4) devouring usury, (5) consuming the property of an orphan, running back from the battlefield and, (7) slandering chaste women who are believers but indiscreet.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n9.\nFour characteristics constitute anyone who possesses them a sheer hypocrite, and anyone who possesses one of them possesses a characteristic of hypocrisy till he abandons it: when he is trusted he betrays his trust, when he talks he lies, when he makes a covenant he acts treacherously and when he quarrels he abuses.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nKNOWLEDGE 10.\nWhen a man dies no further reward is recorded for his actions, with three exceptions: Sadqa which continues to be supplied, or knowledge from which benefit continues to be reaped, or the prayers of a good son to his dead father.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n11.\nIf anyone removes (one of the) anxieties of this world from a believer, God will remove (one of the) anxieties from him on the Day of Resurrection; if one smoothes the way for one who is destitute, God will smooth the way for him in this world and the next; and if anyone conceals the faults of a Muslim, God will conceal his faults in this world and the next.\nGod helps a man as long as he helps his brother.\nIf anyone pursues a path in search of knowledge God will thereby make easy for him a path to paradise.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n12.\nHe who goes out in search of knowledge is in God's path till he returns.\n(Tirmidhi, Darimi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n13.\nThe search of knowledge is an obligation laid on every Muslim.\n(Ibn Majah, Baihaqi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n14.\nThe one who would have the worst position in God's sight on the Day of Resurrection would be a learned man who did not profit from his learning.\n(Darimi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nSUPPLICATIONS(DUA) 15.\nA man is granted supplication provided he does not ask for anything sinful or for breaking ties of relationship.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n16.\nYou have two characters which God likes; gentleness and deliberation.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n17.\nNothing but supplication averts the decree, and nothing but righteousness increases life.\n(Tirmidhi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nREMEMBRANCE OF ALLAH 18.\nPeople will not sit remembering God without the angels surrounding them, mercy covering them, peace descending on them.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n19.\nHe who remembers his Lord and he who does not are like the living and dead.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n20.\nHadhrat Jaabir (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"The distinguishing factor between kufr and Imaan is the deliberate neglect of Salaat.\" (Muslim).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n21.\nHe who does a good deed will have ten times the amount of blessings, and I [God] shall give more, but he who does an evil deed will have an equivalent reward of evil, or I shall grant forgiveness.\nIf anyone draws the length of a span near Me, I shall draw the length of a cubit near him, and if anyone draws the length of a cubit near Me, I shall draw the length of a fathom near him.\nIf anyone comes to Me walking I shall come to him at a run, and if anyone meets me with sins of the size of the earth, but has not associated anything with Me, I shall meet him a similar amount of forgiveness.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n22.\nHadhrat Jaabir (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Salaat is the key to Jannat.\" (Darami).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n23.\nHadrhat Abdulah Ibn Qart (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"The first act about which one will be questioned on the Day of Qiyammah will be Salaat.\nIf Salaat is found to be proper, other acts will pass as proper.\nBut, if Salaat is found there to be despoiled, then all other acts too will fail.\" (Tibrani, Ausat).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n24.\nHadhrat Hanzalah (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that he heard Muhammad say: \"Whoever guards the five Salaat while believing that the Salaat is the Right of Allah, will enter Jannat.\" (Ahmad).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n25.\nHadhrat Bareedah (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"The subject of pledge which exists between the people and us (the Ambiyaa) is Salaat.\nThus, whoever neglects Salaat has become a kaafir (i.e.\nin terms of practical life, not in terms of Imaan).\" (Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Nisai, Ibn Majah).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n26.\nA time will come to mankind when man will not care whether what he gets comes from a lawful or an unlawful source.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n27.\nHadhrat Abu Hurairah (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Will there remain any impurity on a person who baths five times a day in a river flowing in front of his house?\" The people said: \"No impurity will remain on him.\" Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"This is the effect of the five Salaat.\nBy means of it, Allah Ta'ala purifies the performer of all sins.\" (Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n28.\nHadhrat Abdur Rahmaan Bin Amr Bin Al-A's (Allah be pleased with him) narrates that Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Salaat on the Day of Qiyaamah, will be a light, a proof and a means of salvation for the one who guarded it.\nHe who neglects Salaat, will have no light, no proof and no salvation (from the direction of Salaat) He (the one who neglects Salaat) will be in the company of Qaroon, Fir'oun, Haamaan and Ubay Ibn Khalf on the Day of Qiyaamah.\" (Ahmad, Darami, Baihaqi, Shu'bul Imaan).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n29.\nNo body which has been nourished with what is unlawful will enter paradise.\n(Baihaqi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n30.\nFlesh which has grown out of what is unlawful will not enter paradise, but hell is more fitting for all flesh which has grown out of what is unlawful.\n(Ahmad, Darimi, Baihaqi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n31.\nThe truthful and trusty merchant is associated with the prophets, the upright and the martyrs.\n(Tirmidhi, Darimi, Daraqutni).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n32.\nIf anyone buys a garment for ten dirhams among which one is unlawfully acquired, God most high will not accept prayer from him as long as he wears it.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nTHOSE WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BEG 33.\nHe who begs the property of others to increase his own is asking only for live coals, so let him ask little as much.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n34.\nIt is better for one of you to take a rope, bring a load of firewood on his back, and sell it, God thereby preserving his self respect, than that he should beg from people whether they give him anything or refuse him.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n35.\nIf anyone guarantees me that he will not beg from people, I will guarantee him paradise.\n(Abu Dawud, Nasa'i).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nSPENDING 36.\nIf you spend (to help others), O son of Adam! I [God] shall spend on you.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n37.\nIt is better for a man to give a dirham as Sadqa during his lifetime than to give a hundred at the time of his death.\n(Abu Dawud).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n38.\nDo not consider any act of kindness insignificant, even meeting your brother with a cheerful face.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n39.\nSadqa given to a poor man is just Sadqa, but when given to a relative it serves a double purpose, being both Sadqa and a connecting link.\n(Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Nasai, Ibn Majah, Darimi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nHOARDING 40.\nIf anyone keeps goods till the price rises, he is a sinner.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n41.\nHe who brings goods for sale is blessed with good fortune, but he who keeps them till the price rises is accursed.\n(Ibn Majah, Darimi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n42.\nIf anyone withholds grain for forty days thereby desiring a high price, has renounced God and God has renounced him.\n(Razin).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n43.\nThe man who withholds goods is evil.\nIf God lowers prices he is grieved, and if He raises then he is happy.\n(Baihaqi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nINSOLVENCY AND RESPITE 44.\nHe who grants a respite to one who is in straightened circumstances or who remits his debt, will be saved by God from the anxieties of the Day of Resurrection.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n45.\nIf anyone accepts others belongings meaning to pay back, God will pay back for him, but if anyone accepts them meaning to squander them, God will on that account destroy his property.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n46.\nEvery fault but a debt will be forgiven to a martyr.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n47.\nA believer's soul is attached to his debt till it is paid.\n(Shafi'i, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Darimi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nUSURY 48.\nGold is to be paid by gold, silver by silver, wheat by wheat, barley by barley, dates by dates and salt by salt, like for like, payment being made on the spot.\nIf anyone gives more or asks for more, he has dealt in usury.\nThe receiver and the giver are equally guilty.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n49.\nA time is coming to mankind when only the receiver of usury will remain and if he does not receive it, some of its vapour will reach him.\n(Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Nasai, Ibn Majah).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n50.\nA dirham which a man knowingly receives in usury is more serious (a crime) than thirty-six acts of fornication.\n(Ahmad, Daraqutni).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n51.\nWhen a man makes a loan to another, he must not accept a present.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n52.\nEven though usury be much it leads in the end to penury.\n(Ibn Majah, Baihaqi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nMARRIAGE 53.\nYoung men, those of you who can support a wife should marry, for it keeps you from looking at strange women and preserves you from immorality, but those who cannot, should devote themselves to fasting, for it is a means of suppressing sexual desire.\n(Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n54.\nThe whole world is to be enjoyed, but the best thing in the world is a pious woman.\n(Muslim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n55.\nWhen a man marries, he has fulfilled half of the religion, so let him fear Go regarding the remaining half.\n(Bukhari).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n56.\nAfter fear of God, a believer gains nothing better for him than a good wife who obeys him if he gives her a command, pleases him if he looks at her, is true to him if he adjures her to do something, and is sincere towards him regarding her person and his property if he is absent.\n(Ibn Majah.) (Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nRIGHTS OF WIVES 57.\nWhen a woman observes the five time of prayers, fasts during Ramadan, preserves her chastity, and obeys her husband, she may enter by any of the gates of paradise she wishes.\n(Abu Nu'aim).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n58.\nA believer must not hate his wife, and if he is displeased with one bad quality in her, then let him be pleased with one that is good in her.\n(Muslim).\n(Ideal Woman in Islam by.\nImran Muhammad).\n59.\nAmong the believers who show most perfect faith are those who have best disposition and are kindest to their families.\n(Tirmidhi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nDIVORCE 60.\nIf any woman asks her husband for divorce without some strong reason, the odour of paradise will be forbidden for her.\n(Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Darimi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n61.\nThe lawful thing God hates most is divorce.\n(Abu Dawud).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n62.\nGod has created nothing on the face of the earth more dearer to Him than emancipation, and God has created nothing on the face of the earth more hateful to Him than divorce.\n(Daraqutni).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\nTHE OFFICES OF RULER AND QADI (QAZI) 63.\nThe one who will be dearest to God and nearest to Him in the station on the Day of Resurrection will be a just imam and the one who will be most hateful to God on the Day of Resurrection, and will receive the severest punishment will be a tyrannical imam.\n(Tirmidhi).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n64.\nA creature is not to be obeyed when it involves disobedience to the Creator.\n(Sharra-as-Sunna).\n(Sayings of Muhammad.\nby Prof.\nGhazi Ahmad).\n65.\nDo not ask for any high office, for if you are given it after asking, you will be left to discharge it yourself;

        "RECITING AND TEACHING THE QUR'AN MAJEED": "491.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"He who recites the Qur'an well and clearly is equal in rank to the Angels who record creation's deeds.\nThese Angels are gracious, honourable and of lofty rank.\nHe who finds difficulty in reciting the Qur'an will obtain a double reward.\" (Bukhari, Muslim).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n492.\nA person whose breast is devoid of the Qur'an (i.e.\nhas not learnt anything of the Qur'an Majeed) is like a desolate house.\n(Tirmidhi).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n493.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"A person who recites one harf (letter) of the Qur'an, obtains one virtue; each virtue multiplies to ten virtues.\nI am not saying that (ALM) is one harf.\nBut, Alif in it is one harf; the Laam in it is one harf and the Meem in it is one harf.\" (Tirmidhi, Darimi).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n494.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"On the day of Qiyaamah a crown of such brilliance will be placed on the heads of the parents of one who learnt the Qur'an and practised on its laws, that its glitter will outshine the brilliance of the sun which penetrates your houses.\nWhat then do you think will be the position of the one who himself learnt the Qur'an and acted in accordance with it?\" (Ahmad, Abu Dawud).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n495.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"He who recites the Qur'an, memorizes it,accepts its halal (lawful things) as halal and haram (forbidden things) as haram (i.e.\nhis beliefs in these matters are correct), Allah Ta'ala will enter him to Jannat and accept his intercession on behalf of ten such persons of his family upon whom entry into Janhannum has become incumbent (i.e.\nAllah Ta'ala will forgive them because of his intercession).\" (Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Darimi).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n496.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Continue reciting the Qur'an because on the Day of Qiyaamah it will appear as an intercessor for the reciter.\" (Muslim).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n497.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"He who listens to even a single aayat (being recited by another) obtains such a virtue which perpetually multiplies (it increases in thawaab continuously).\nThe one who recited the aayat will on the Day of Qiyaamah find the recited aayat in the form of a Noor (which will be of greater value and significance than the virtue which accrued to the one who had listened to the recitation).\" (Ahmad).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n498.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"The best of you are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it.\" (Bukhari).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n499.\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"On the Day of Qiyaamah the Qur'an will petition Allah to cloak the one who had recited it with garments of honour and respect.\nA crown of honour will then be placed on the head of the reciter.\nThe Qur'an will then petition Allah Ta'ala to shower His pleasure on the reciter.\nAllah will then become pleased with him.\nThe reciter will then be asked to recite the Qur'an, thereby attaining higher ranks of elevation.\nIn reward for each aayat a virtue will accrue to him.\" (Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaimah).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi).\n500.\nContinue climbing (higher and higher in rank) with your recitation in the same way as you recited with care and concern on earth.\nYour abode (of residing) is located (at that rank attained) with the last aayat recited.\n(Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Habbaan).\n(Hayaat-ul-Muslimeen.\nby Mohammad Ashraf Ali Thanvi)."
